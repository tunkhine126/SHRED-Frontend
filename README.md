## SHRED
The premiere app for searching mountain biking trails near you, adding them to your profile and finding friends to ride with. 

## MOTIVATION
SHRED is my Capstone Project for the Flatiron School that encapsulates the programming languages and skills I've learned through my software engineering journey. I wanted to build something that showcased my current level of knowledge paired with my love of biking, while pushing myself to refine my coding skills. 

## INSTALL/GETTING STARTED
SHRED's backend is hosted on Heroku and frontend hosted on Firebase.

## BUILD STATUS
While no project is ever complete and the list of features I'd like to add are extensive, SHRED exceeds the project requirements set out by my Project Managers. My initial project pitch can be found at 'https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WvBtd1Uui1Jyl4fkN7EZGjY-tTShI6gw4Plh1WV1mGY/edit?usp=sharing'
